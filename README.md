No Warranties
THE APPLICATION IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" AND WITH ALL FAULTS AND DEFECTS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, PROOF, ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OWNERS, PARTNERS, AND LICENSORS, IF ANY, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION, INCLUDING ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR OTHER WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE OR TRADE PRACTICE.  WITHOUT LIMITATION TO THE FOREGOING, PROOF PROVIDES NO WARRANTY OR UNDERTAKING, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OF ANY KIND THAT THE APPLICATION WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, ACHIEVE ANY INTENDED RESULTS, BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS, SYSTEMS OR SERVICES, OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, MEET ANY PERFORMANCE OR RELIABILITY STANDARDS, OR BE ERROR FREE OR THAT ANY ERRORS OR DEFECTS CAN OR WILL BE CORRECTED.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, NEITHER PROOF NOR ANY OF PROOF’S PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OWNERS, PARTNERS, AND LICENSORS, IF ANY, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED: (I) AS TO THE OPERATION OR AVAILABILITY OF THE APPLICATION, OR THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, AND MATERIALS OR PRODUCTS INCLUDED THEREON; (II) THAT THE APPLICATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; (III) AS TO THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR CURRENCY OF ANY INFORMATION OR CONTENT PROVIDED THROUGH THE APPLICATION; OR (IV) THAT THE APPLICATION, ITS SERVERS, CONTENT, OR E-MAILS SENT FROM OR ON BEHALF OF PROOF ARE FREE OF VIRUSES, SCRIPTS, TROJAN HORSES, WORMS, MALWARE, TIMEBOMBS OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY PROOF SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.  SIMILARLY, NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION SHOULD BE CONSTRUED AS TO OFFER A PROMISE OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT, APPLICATION REPAIR OR MODIFICATION, OR PROMISE THAT THE APPLICATION CAN BE INTEGRATED WITH ANY THIRD PARTY SOLUTIONS OR SOFTWARE.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.

Limitation of Liability
Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of Proof and any of its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, owners, partners, and licensors, combined, based upon a breach of any provision of this Agreement or under any other theory of law, whether in tort, contract, statutory, or otherwise, shall be limited to any fees paid by you to Proof for this Application during the last twelve (12) months of this Agreement.  You understand and agree that this is your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL PROOF OR ANY OF ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OWNERS, PARTNERS, AND LICENSORS, IF ANY, BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR OTHER INFORMATION, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OF PRIVACY ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLICATION, THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE AND/OR THIRD PARTY HARDWARE USED WITH THE APPLICATION, OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT), EVEN IF PROOF OR ANY OF THESE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS LIMITATION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES PROVISION SHALL BE ENFORCED INDEPENDENTLY OF AND SURVIVE THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY WARRANTY REMEDY.

Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

Severability
If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

Waiver
Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute waiver of any subsequent breach.

Instructions

1. Use the Records Menu to create a new chart or explore through the pre-loaded charts
2. Start editing the options of the charts. On commit the chart will reload, or use the refresh chart button to refresh. 
3. Once your chart is looking the way you want, go to Export and follow the instructions. 
4. Paste HTML from the clipboard to a text field in your preference table.
5. In a webviewer or using a calculation field - Paste the susbtitute calculation and map where the data and labels are coming from as well as where you stored the chart HTML. **NOTE** If you chose not to add placeholders you will need to remove the sample data and labels and add your own place holders for each dataset, and a placeholder for the labels.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Special Considerations

1. Data formatting - Data must be formatted in a JSON Array as numbers - [12,24,36,48,60]
2. Chart Labels - Labels must be formatted in a JSON Array as string - ["Label1","Label2","Label3","Label4","Label5"]
3. The total count of labels and the total count of data should match - IE. If you have 5 labels you should have 5 points of data like shown above.
